# Flask Fire

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/skytreader/flask-fire.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/skytreader/flask-fire)
[![Coverage Status](https://coveralls.io/repos/skytreader/flask-fire/badge.svg?branch=master&service=github)](https://coveralls.io/github/skytreader/flask-fire?branch=master)

Fire up Flask and just get started coding.

Batteries (and examples) included to emphasize testing. Quick to set-up for
hackathons.

A more "complete" example is [over here](https://github.com/skytreader/alexandria).

# Additional Bangs and Whizes

The emphasis of this stack is for quick set-up (during hackathons, where internet
might be shitty, if you did not set-up before going there) and for testability
(which my be weird since _who writes unit tests during hackathons hahahagoodone_?).

If you are creating something that will run for more than your 5-minute hackathon
pitch, you may want to take a look (and install) the libraries in
`more-requirements.txt`.
